        The manifest provides a list of all currently relevant batch files. Clients should only download batches that  
        they haven't already retrieved. Batches are immutable (TODO check with Key file spec by Google/Apple:  
        are they indeed supposed to be immutable?), so a file, once retrieved, should never be retrieved again.

      summary: Exchange a secret with the server so we can sign our keys
      description: |
        This method is called by a device to exchange a secret, in the fallback flow (in case a secret wasn't yet 
        exchanged in the test facility). 
        The secret is stored in an anonymous bucket on the server where later the TEK keys will be dropped.
        The device sends a labConfirmationId in the request that will also be stored in the bucket.
        This labConfirmationId is generated on the device and read by the device owner to the operator who submits
        the key to the server out-of-band.
        The method returns a confirmationKey.

        Notes: the phone will never know whether a test result was positive, for privacy reasons. This means that a user might upload keys using this method by using the 'I've been tested positive' flow even though there isn't a positive test result. This is OK, since without the positive test result, the keys won't be processed. It also creates a decoy in itself: seeing keys being uploaded does not consitute a sign of infection.

              The request should add padding for observer protection, so that the length of a request does not reveal that this is a /postkeys call. 
              The size of the padding should be randomized from a negative exponential distribution so that the total request message size is between 
              `Appconfig.requestMinimumSize` and `Appconfig.requestMaximumSize`.
